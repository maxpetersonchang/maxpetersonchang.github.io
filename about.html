					<p>the plot of cars 3 is apparently about lightning mcqueen feeling his age. younger cars with hotter tech are running him off the track... take one lool at mater and tell me he doesnt know what that feels like. lightning is being run off the track into maters gentle, loving, understanding tires. he knows exactly who lightning is and, despite all his flaws, loves him. a family can be two ungracefully aging cars</p>
					<p class="dark">Is it weird that I always buy Fruit Loops whenever I go to the store? I see all those kids running around with their Fruit Loops making a mess on the floor and wasting their fruity goodness. How come I get laughed at by the register lady whenever I put my 10 boxes of Fruity Loops on the counter. How come those sick bastards get to eat the delectable taste of fruit in a loopy, crunchy form and I don't?</p>
